# Introduction to SYCL

In this module, we introduce **SYCL** as a modern, open-standard programming model designed for heterogeneous computing. The primary objective of this module is to help participants understand **why SYCL was introduced** and **what challenges it addresses** in today’s computing environments. We begin by discussing the growing complexity of hybrid systems that combine CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators, and explain how SYCL simplifies programming for such systems through a **single-source C++ programming model**.

Participants will learn how SYCL allows **host code and device code to coexist in the same source file**, reducing development complexity and improving productivity compared to traditional accelerator programming models that require separate host and device codebases.

This module also introduces the core principles behind SYCL, including **performance portability**, **standard C++ integration**, and **cross-vendor support** defined by the SYCL standard. We provide a high-level overview of fundamental SYCL concepts such as **devices, queues, kernels, and memory models**, without delving into implementation details.

By the end of this module, participants will have a clear conceptual understanding of SYCL, its role in **high-performance and data-parallel computing**, and how it enables applications to execute on multiple devices using a single, portable programming model.
